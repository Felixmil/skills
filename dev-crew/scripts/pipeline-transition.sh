#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Usage: pipeline-transition.sh <issues-root> <issue> <to-status>
# Reads the issue's current status from <issues-root>/<issue>/state.json,
# checks the current -> to edge against the transition table below, and
# only then rewrites the "status" field in place, leaving every other
# field untouched.
#
# A transition to the status already in effect is an idempotent no-op:
# it exits 0 without rewriting the file (see the guard below). This makes
# re-applying the same transition harmless, so a caller that re-enters a
# phase and re-issues its transition does not crash on an X -> X edge the
# table does not list. Every genuinely different edge still goes through
# the table and a disallowed one fails loudly.
#
# This script ships INSIDE the plugin (at scripts/pipeline-transition.sh)
# and both pipeline skills invoke it via the plugin-root path variable,
# `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pipeline-transition.sh" ...`, so it
# never needs copying into a target repo. No agent or skill is allowed to
# write state.json's "status" field directly; this script is the only
# thing that moves the state machine, so an illegal transition fails
# loudly instead of quietly corrupting the issue's state.
#
# State lives entirely in the local state.json (status is a bare field, no
# "status:" prefix). Nothing here reads or writes a GitHub label, so both
# pipelines work in repos where status:* labels are unavailable or
# uncreatable. The edge set is transcribed from OpenDucktor's transition
# policy, minus the task/bug skip-spec fast-path (every issue runs the
# full spec -> plan -> build -> QA path).
#
# The bug pipeline (skills/debug-pipeline) shares this script. It swaps the
# spec phase for an investigate phase, so it uses a parallel entry segment
# (open -> investigated) that rejoins the shared path at ready-for-dev, plus
# an investigate-awaiting-approval manual gate and a terminal not-a-bug
# early-exit status. The feature pipeline never emits these and the bug
# pipeline never emits spec-ready; a state.json belongs to whichever pipeline
# took its first edge, so sharing one script does not let one skill wander
# into the other's states.
#
# The four *-awaiting-approval statuses are gates used only in the
# skill's manual mode. A gate is entered from the status that precedes a
# phase and, once a human approves, exits to the exact real status that
# phase's output would have produced in auto mode. Auto/semi-auto mode
# never touches these statuses.
