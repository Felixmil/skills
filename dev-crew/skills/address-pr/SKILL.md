name: address-pr
description: Takes a pull request number and brings it back to green and to a resolved review state, fixing CI/CD failures and addressing the valid review comments (fixing, pushing, replying) while skipping the invalid ones with a reasoned note, grounded in the issue's spec/plan so fixes stay in scope. Use when the user says "fix the CI on PR N", "address the review comments on PR N", "the PR is red, fix it", or invokes /address-pr with a PR number (optionally with steering).

# Address PR

You take one pull request and drive it toward mergeable: **fix its CI/CD failures** and **address its valid review comments**. You do the actual code changes by delegating to the `builder` (invoke it with that exact `subagent_type`; it knows how to write repo-quality code and push to a PR branch), and you own the investigation, the validity judgment, and the reviewer communication.

The toolkit's standing stance applies: **act on the provably safe, escalate the judgment call, never guess.** A reviewer comment is not automatically an instruction, and a red check is not automatically a code defect.

## What you are handed

- A **PR number** (required).
- Optional **free-form steering** after it. This is NOT limited to a fixed `ci`/`reviews` mode; honor whatever the user says. Examples:
  - `/address-pr 42` — do whatever the PR needs (auto-detect, below).
  - `/address-pr 42 ci` — only the CI failures.
  - `/address-pr 42 reviews` — only the review comments.
  - `/address-pr 42 just the failing R-CMD-check` — scope to that check.
  - `/address-pr 42 focus on the reviewer's error-handling concern` — scope to specific feedback. Read the steering and let it narrow or direct the work; with no steering, auto-detect what the PR needs.

## Setup

1. **Load the PR**: `gh pr view <PR> --json number,title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,state,url` and `gh pr diff <PR>`. Note the head branch (the builder works on it) and the base branch (the target it merges into).
2. **Bring the branch up to date with its target first.** A branch that is behind its base can show CI failures or attract review comments that the target branch has *already* fixed, so syncing before you diagnose avoids chasing problems that no longer exist. Delegate this to the `update-branch` skill (it merges `baseRefName` into the head branch, never a rebase, so review threads and comment anchors survive, and drives the conflict resolver if the merge conflicts). If it brought changes in, push the updated branch and re-read the PR state (checks and comments) against it before proceeding. If the branch is already current, `update-branch` says so and there is nothing to sync.
3. **Find the issue's spec/plan for grounding.** The agreed spec and plan are what make a review comment "valid" or "out of scope", so locate them:
   - **Primary (reverse-lookup):** derive the state root from git (`<parent>/<repo>.issues`), then find the issue folder whose `state.json.prNumber` equals this PR number, searching both the active set (`<root>/*/`) and the archive (`<root>/archive/*/`, where `/merge-pr` moves a merged issue). That folder's `spec.md` and `plan.md` are the grounding.
   - **Fallback (PR body):** if no `state.json` matches, parse the PR body: a `Closes #N` points to `<root>/N/` (or `<root>/archive/N/` if merged); a local-issue PR references its `L`-id in text pointing to `<root>/L#/` (or its archived location).
   - **If neither resolves** (PR made outside the pipeline): proceed **without** spec/plan grounding, and say so explicitly, you will judge comments on code merit alone, and cannot check scope against a contract. Do not invent a spec/plan.
4. **Auto-detect the work** (unless steering narrows it): run `gh pr checks <PR>` to see if any check is failing (the CI job), and read the review comments (the reviews job). Do whichever apply; do both if both apply.

## Job 1: CI/CD failures

1. **Identify the failing checks**: `gh pr checks <PR>` lists each check and its state. For each failing one, read its logs: `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed` (get the run id from the check's details link, or `gh run list --branch <headRefName>`).
2. **Diagnose the root cause per failing check.** Distinguish a real code defect (a failing test, a lint error, a broken build, an R CMD check NOTE/WARNING/ERROR) from an infra/flaky failure (a timeout, a network error, a runner hiccup, a cache miss). Only code defects are yours to fix; for an infra/flaky failure, say so and do not "fix" code that is not broken (a re-run is the remedy, which you may note but not trigger blindly).
3. **Fix code defects** by delegating to the builder: hand it the PR number, the head branch, the failing check's diagnosis and log excerpt, and the spec/plan paths (so the fix stays in scope). It makes the change, pushes to the PR branch, and updates the build summary.
4. **Re-check**: after pushing, confirm the fix by re-reading `gh pr checks <PR>` (the checks re-run on push). If still red for the same reason, iterate a bounded number of times (default 3 total attempts per check); if still failing, stop and report the remaining failure rather than thrash.
5. If a fix is **ambiguous** (more than one plausible root cause, or the fix would change behavior in a way the spec/plan does not cover), escalate via `AskUserQuestion` before pushing, do not guess on a behavior change.

## Job 2: review comments

1. **Collect the comments.** There are two kinds, handled differently at reply time (below): **inline review comments** (attached to specific lines, from `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments`) and **general PR comments / review summaries** (`gh pr view <PR> --json comments,reviews`). Read them all, including any prior replies, so you do not re-address something already handled.
2. **Classify each comment against the code AND the spec/plan:**
   - **Clearly valid + mechanical** (a real bug, a typo, a missing test, a naming/consistency fix that matches repo conventions, a documented edge case not handled): **fix it** via the builder.
   - **Invalid or misguided** (based on a misreading, asks for something the code already does, contradicts an established repo convention or a passing test's guarantee): **skip it**, with a brief, specific, respectful reason.
   - **Out of PR scope** (the comment asks for work beyond what this issue's spec/plan committed to): **skip it as out-of-scope**, citing the spec/plan, and suggest it belongs in a follow-up issue rather than silently expanding this PR.
   - **Spec/plan violation** (the comment correctly points out that the code deviates from the agreed spec/plan): treat as clearly valid and fix, this is exactly the kind of comment to honor.
   - **Bad spec/plan entry** (the comment is valid on its merits but reveals that the spec/plan itself was wrong or incomplete): this is a judgment call, not a silent fix. **Escalate via `AskUserQuestion`**: changing behavior the spec explicitly specified needs your call, and the spec/plan may need updating too.
   - **Genuine judgment call** (a design tradeoff, a subjective style preference, anything where reasonable people differ): **escalate via `AskUserQuestion`** with the reviewer's point and a recommended stance; do not decide unilaterally.
3. **Apply the fixes** for the clearly-valid set in one builder delegation where practical (batch related changes), handing it the comments to address, the diff, and the spec/plan paths. It pushes to the PR branch.
4. **Never expand scope** to satisfy a comment: if addressing it correctly would exceed the spec/plan, it is the out-of-scope case above, not a fix.

## Escalation (the interactive core)

For every judgment call, bad-spec finding, or ambiguous CI fix, use `AskUserQuestion`: state the reviewer's point (or the ambiguity), what the spec/plan says, and a recommended option, then act on the answer. Put all context inside the question and options; do not rely on prose printed before the call (it can be dropped in a background session). If a question goes unanswered, do not guess, leave that item unaddressed and report it.

## Replying to reviewers

After pushing fixes:

- **Inline review comments**: reply **per comment**, on that comment's own thread (`gh api ... /pulls/comments/<id>/replies` or `gh pr review`/`gh api` reply), saying what changed for an addressed one or why it was skipped (citing spec/plan for out-of-scope) for a skipped one. Do **not** resolve the threads; leave that to the reviewer.
- **General PR comments / review summaries** (not tied to a line): post a **single summary PR comment** (`gh pr comment <PR>`) covering the non-inline feedback, what was addressed and what was skipped and why.
- Keep replies brief, specific, and respectful. Never dismiss a comment without a concrete reason.

## Anti-patterns

- Treating every review comment as an instruction. Judge validity and scope against the spec/plan first.
- Silently implementing a comment that exceeds the PR's spec/plan scope, or that contradicts what the spec explicitly specified. Escalate or skip-with-reason instead.
- "Fixing" an infra/flaky CI failure by changing working code.
- Guessing on a behavior-changing fix or a judgment call. Escalate.
- Resolving review threads on the reviewer's behalf.
- Editing files or pushing yourself instead of delegating code changes to the builder (it carries the repo-quality bar and the push-to-branch behavior).
- Inventing a spec/plan when none is found; say you are judging on code merit alone.
- Thrashing on a check that will not go green; stop after a bounded number of attempts and report.

## Done criteria

The branch was brought up to date with its target before diagnosing (or confirmed already current), so no already-solved failure or comment was chased; every failing CI check has been either fixed-and-pushed (and re-checked toward green) or reported as infra/flaky/unresolvable with a reason; every review comment has been addressed (fixed + replied), skipped (with a reasoned reply citing spec/plan where relevant), or escalated to you and resolved; replies went per-comment on inline threads and as one summary for general feedback; threads were left unresolved for the reviewer; and no change exceeded the issue's spec/plan scope without your explicit approval. If no spec/plan could be found, that limitation was stated up front.
