description: Brings a branch up to date with its target by merging the target into it, and drives the conflict-resolver only if that merge conflicts, asking you inline only about genuine semantic conflicts the resolver cannot safely settle on its own. Use when a branch is behind its base and needs the base merged in, when a PR shows as BEHIND, or when the user says "update the branch", "merge main into this branch", "bring my branch up to date", "resolve the conflicts", or invokes /update-branch.

# Update branch

You bring a branch up to date with its target: **merge the target branch into it**, and when that merge conflicts, drive the `conflict-resolver` agent to settle the conflicts, escalating only the genuinely semantic ones to the user. A clean merge finishes on its own; a conflicted one resolves the safe hunks automatically and asks you only about the risky ones.

This is the toolkit's standing stance: **act on the provably safe, escalate the judgment call, never guess.** A fast-forward or a conflict-free merge needs no one; a semantic conflict always gets the user's call.

## What you are handed

- Optional **branch name**. A bare `/update-branch` updates the **current** branch. `/update-branch <branch>` checks out (or targets) that branch.
- Optional **target**. By default the target is the branch's base (its upstream's base, the PR's `baseRefName`, or the repo default branch, in that order). `/update-branch <branch> onto <target>` overrides it.
- Optional **issue** for intent: if the branch maps to a pipeline issue, its `spec.md`/`plan.md` under `<repo>.issues/<issue>/` help the resolver judge conflicts. Passed through to the resolver when available.

## Setup

1. **Identify the branch and its target.** `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for the repo path; the current branch from `git branch --show-current` (or the handed branch). Determine the target: an explicit `onto <target>` wins; otherwise the tracked base / PR `baseRefName` / repo default branch. State which target you resolved and why if it is not obvious.
2. **Fetch and check whether an update is even needed.** `git fetch` the target, then `git rev-list --left-right --count <target>...<branch>`. If the branch is **not behind** the target (left count zero), tell the user it is already up to date and stop, there is nothing to merge.
3. **Confirm a clean working tree.** If the tree is dirty (uncommitted changes), stop and tell the user to commit or stash first; do not merge over uncommitted work.

## Merge the target in

1. **Run the merge**: `git merge <target>` into the branch (a merge, never a rebase, so a shared/reviewed branch keeps its history and any PR review threads and comment anchors survive).
2. **If the merge completes cleanly** (fast-forward or auto-merged, no conflicts): report what came in (a short `git log` range summary) and stop. The branch is now current. Do not push unless the user asks.
3. **If the merge conflicts**: the tree is now in a conflicted merge state. Hand it to the conflict-resolver via the loop below.

## The conflict loop you run

You are the thin human-interaction shell around `conflict-resolver`. The agent does the actual conflict analysis and resolution in the working tree; it cannot ask you a question (subagents cannot prompt), so it stops and returns a structured `clarification-needed` result whenever a conflict is genuinely semantic. **Your job is to turn that into an `AskUserQuestion`, take the answer, and re-invoke the agent with your decision, until it reports everything resolved.**

The agent auto-resolves only conflicts it can prove are safe (both sides equivalent, one a pure superset, disjoint additions, formatting/import order). It never guesses on a real semantic conflict; those come back to you.

1. **Invoke the agent** (`conflict-resolver`) with a `schema` forcing its structured return, handing it the repo path, the operation (a merge of `<target>` into `<branch>`) and the target branch, and any issue intent paths. On the first call, no decision; on later calls, include the decision the user just made and which file/conflict it applies to.

2. **Read the agent's returned object:**
   - `{"status":"done", ...}` -> the tree is resolved, staged, and verified (build/tests pass over the merged result). The merge is ready to commit. Complete the merge (`git commit --no-edit` to finalize the merge commit) so the branch is actually up to date, then report the summary. Do not push unless the user asks.
   - `{"status":"clarification-needed", question, options, recommendedDefault, file}` -> a semantic conflict needs the user (step 3).

3. **Surface the conflict with `AskUserQuestion`.** Build the call directly from the returned `question` and `options`, recommended option first. **Do not print the conflict as prose before the call;** everything the user needs (the file, what each side does, the recommended resolution) is inside the returned question and option text. Keep the options as the agent framed them (typically: take side A, take side B, or combine).

4. **Re-invoke the agent** with the user's chosen resolution folded into its inputs (the decision plus the `file` it applies to), so it applies exactly that resolution to exactly that conflict and moves on.

5. **Go back to step 2.** Repeat until the agent returns `done`. The agent may escalate several conflicts across several round-trips; each is answered before it proceeds.

## If a question goes unanswered

If `AskUserQuestion` returns no usable answer (timed out, empty, declined), **do not guess and do not tell the agent to pick a side.** Stop. Leave the working tree exactly as the agent left it (safe hunks resolved and staged, the escalated semantic hunk still marked and unstaged), and tell the user which conflict is still open so they can re-run `/update-branch` and answer it. A half-resolved tree with the hard conflict still clearly marked is a safe place to stop; a guessed merge is not. Do **not** leave the paused merge unexplained; say the merge is stopped mid-conflict.

## Anti-patterns

- Rebasing instead of merging. This skill merges the target in on purpose, so shared/reviewed branches keep their history and comment anchors.
- Merging over a dirty tree, or when the branch is not actually behind. Check first; if there is nothing to do, say so and stop.
- Guessing a resolution, or telling the agent to pick a side, when a question went unanswered. Stop instead.
- Printing the conflict as prose before `AskUserQuestion`. Put it all inside the question and option text (the agent already framed it there).
- Resolving conflicts yourself with your own `Edit`/`git add`. The agent owns the working tree; you only ask and relay decisions.
- Pushing on the user's behalf. Finalize the merge commit so the branch is current, but leave pushing to the user unless they asked.

## Done criteria

The branch was already current (nothing to do, reported), or the target was merged in: cleanly (reported what came in), or with conflicts driven to `done` by the agent (tree has zero conflict markers, every previously conflicted file staged, build and relevant tests passing over the merged result) with the merge commit finalized so the branch is genuinely up to date, and every semantic conflict decided by the user via `AskUserQuestion` (never guessed). Pushing was left to the user unless they asked. Or the run stopped cleanly on an unanswered question, with the safe hunks staged, the hard conflict still marked, and the paused merge state reported for a re-run.
